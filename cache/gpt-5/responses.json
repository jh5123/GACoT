That means it tends to \u201czig\u201d when your current holdings \u201czag,\u201d which smooths returns and lowers volatility.\n\nHow much: After the addition, the new asset would be about 14.7% of the total portfolio ($1.35M of ~$9.14M).

It would take the new asset being more than about 4x as volatile as your current portfolio for the risk not to decline.\n\nCaveats:\n- The exact reduction depends on the new asset\u2019s own volatility and how stable that -0.11 correlation is over time.\n- Correlations can rise in market stress, so benefits may shrink temporarily.",

Negative correlation means when the existing portfolio dips, the new asset tends to offset some of that move, reducing total volatility.\n\nWhat to expect:\n- With a ~15% allocation and a mildly negative correlation, the reduction in volatility should be modest but real. The exact amount depends on the new asset\u2019s own volatility; unless it\u2019s extremely volatile, overall portfolio standard deviation should decline.\n- Practically, this should smooth returns and slightly reduce drawdowns.

Therefore, adding this negatively correlated sleeve will almost certainly lower your percentage volatility.\n\nIllustrative scenarios (not predictions; for intuition only)\n- Assume \u03c3_old = 12% annualized (typical for a diversified mix). Using the weights and \u03c1 = \u22120.11:\n\n1) If \u03c3_new = 18% (e.g., international equities):\n   - Var_new \u2248 0.0105770 \u2192 \u03c3_new_port \u2248 10.284%\n   - Reduction vs 12%: \u22121.716 percentage points (\u2248 \u221214.3%)\n\n2) If \u03c3_new = 22% (e.g., commodities):\n   - Var_new \u2248 0.0107914 \u2192 \u03c3_new_port \u2248 10.387%\n   - Reduction vs 12%: \u22121.613 percentage points (\u2248 \u221213.4%)\n\nNotes on interpretation\n- Percentage risk (volatility of returns) falls; absolute dollar risk may still rise because the portfolio is larger after adding N.\n- The negative correlation term (\u03c1 < 0) directly reduces the covariance contribution, further lowering risk.\n- Exact magnitudes require your \u03c3_old and \u03c3_new estimates; the direction (risk down) is robust given the inputs.\n\nRecalculation map (what changes when inputs change)\n- If S, B, RE, or N changes:\n  - Recalculate V_old, V_new\n  - Recalculate w_old, w_new\n  - Recalculate k_crit\n  - Recalculate Var_new (and \u03c3_new_port)\n\n- If \u03c1 changes:\n  - Recalculate the covariance term 2 w_old w_new \u03c1 \u03c3_old \u03c3_new\n  - Recalculate k_crit\n  - Recalculate Var_new (and \u03c3_new_port)\n\n- If \u03c3_old changes:\n  - Recalculate Var_old\n  - Recalculate Var_new (and \u03c3_new_port)\n  - Reevaluate k_crit (because it depends on weights and \u03c1; the boundary is expressed as \u03c3_new / \u03c3_old)\n\n- If \u03c3_new changes:\n  - Recalculate Var_new (and \u03c3_new_port)\n  - Reevaluate whether \u03c3_new / \u03c3_old < k_crit\n\nAssumptions to confirm\n- The stated correlation (\u22120.11) is between the new asset\u2019s return and the total existing portfolio return (S/B/RE combined). If it is instead a correlation with only one sleeve (e.g., just stocks) or a uniform correlation to each sleeve, the math must be done at the asset-class level with the full correlation matrix to be precise.\n\nBottom line\n- With a 14.7% allocation to a new asset that has \u03c1 = \u22120.11 to your current portfolio, your overall portfolio volatility will almost certainly decrease. Under typical volatility assumptions for commodities or international equities, expect a roughly 13\u201315% reduction in percentage volatility versus staying fully in the existing mix.",

For example, with \u03c3_existing = 12% and \u03c3_new = 18%:\n  - Before: ~12% of 7,797,051 \u2248 $935k one-sigma dollar move.\n  - After: ~10.3% of 9,143,734 \u2248 $940k one-sigma dollar move (slightly higher due to larger portfolio size).\n\nBottom line\n- With a -0.11 correlation and a ~14.7% allocation to the new asset, Ravi should expect a modest but real reduction in overall portfolio volatility (risk per dollar), i.e., positive Diversification_Benefit. The exact size depends on the new asset\u2019s volatility. Absolute dollar risk may stay similar or rise slightly because the total portfolio size increases.\n\nRecalculation map (what to update if an input changes)\n- If Stocks, Bonds, or Real_Estate changes:\n  - Recalculate: Total_Existing \u2192 Total_With_New \u2192 Portfolio_Risk\n  - Also update weights (w_existing, w_new) if you use them in risk estimation.\n- If New_Asset changes:\n  - Recalculate: Total_With_New \u2192 Portfolio_Risk\n  - Also update weights.\n- If Correlation changes:\n  - Recalculate: Portfolio_Risk and Diversification_Benefit\n\nIf you can share (or choose) estimated volatilities for the existing portfolio and the candidate new asset class, I can quantify the expected risk change more precisely.",
